# Memory-flip-game

The Memory Flip Game is a memory-matching game built using Java Swing. Players flip tiles to reveal  matching pairs, aiming to find all pairs within a time limit. Points are awarded for correct matches and deducted for incorrect ones. The game includes features such as pausing, resuming, starting a new game, and viewing a leaderboard that displays the top three players.
The Memory Flip Game is a graphical game implemented using Java Swing and AWT. Players first enter their name in a GUI prompt before starting the game, which consists of a 4x4 grid (16 tiles). Initially black, 
each tile reveals a value when clicked, and players must match pairs. The game progresses through three levels, each with different time limits: Level 1 (60s, letters A-Z), Level 2 (50s, numbers 1-8), and Level 3 
(40s, fruit names). The scoring system awards 10 points for correct matches and deducts 2 for incorrect ones, updating the total score in real time.The interface includes colorful buttons for pausing, resuming, starting a new game, exiting, and viewing the leaderboard. If time runs out or all pairs are matched, the game either ends or advances to the next level. Player progress is saved in a CSV file, storing name, date, time, and scores. The leaderboard ranks scores in descending order. If a player fails a level, they must restart or exit. The game ends when all pairs are matched or time expires, showing the leaderboard and final score.
